# Example

You're suggested to look up [panto-best-practice](https://github.com/pantojs/panto-best-practice).

`panto-cli` is required to install, _-g_ is suggested.

```sh
npm install panto-cli -g
```

Create a _pantofile.js_ in the root of your project:

```sh
touch pantofile.js
```

It's like _gruntfile.js_ somehow, define a function:

```js
module.exports = panto => {
};
```

Now you can use panto API to define building process.
