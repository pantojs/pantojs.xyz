# Panto<sup>®️</sup>

`Panto` is an extremely flexible engine transforming files.

![panto](img/panto.jpg)

It is built for **transforming files** in a project.

Panto is similar to [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), but more **efficient**, **powerful** and **flexible**. They could be replaced easily. Actually, Panto can do almost everything you want. We will see that soon.
